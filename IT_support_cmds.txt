[PS = Powershell]
[CMD-P = Command Prompt]

!!!MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING POWERSHELL & COMMAND_PROMPT AS ADMINISTRATOR!!!

This shows your OS version, total installed memory (RAM), processor, boot time, and other basic details. It helps me understand your system’s baseline hardware configuration.
[PS] systeminfo

You can run this in CMD or PowerShell.
FreePhysicalMemory: How much memory is unused.
TotalVisibleMemorySize: Total available physical memory. It gives you a quick numerical view of current memory pressure.
[CMD-P or PS] wmic OS get FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize /Value

This lists the processes that are using the most memory (the “Working Set” in bytes). This is crucial to determine whether any processes unexpectedly hog memory.
[PS] Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending WS | Select-Object -First 50 Name, Id, WS

..or you can run this cmd which presents memory usage in megabytes 
[PS] Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending -Property WorkingSet | Select-Object -First 50 Name, Id, @{Name="Memory_MB";Expression={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet/1MB,2)}}

Launch Resource Monitor
[CMD-P] resmon

This shows what is set to run on startup.
[PS] Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_StartupCommand | Select-Object -Property Name, Command, Location

This gives you a list of currently running services. (Some might be unnecessary and could be disabled.)
[PS] Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | Sort-Object DisplayName | Select-Object DisplayName, Status

Free Disk Space
Sometimes high memory usage is accompanied (or exacerbated) by disk congestion. It’s good to know if your disk is overly full or slow.
[CMD-P] wmic logicaldisk get name, size, freespace

Clear out temporary directories (but be cautious): (Take care not to delete things that might be in use!)
ATTENTION: Run this only after reviewing the contents of %TEMP%.
[PS] Remove-Item -Path "$env:TEMP\*" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Listing the Contents of %TEMP%
[PS] Get-ChildItem -Path $env:TEMP -Recurse | Format-List FullName, Length, LastWriteTime

Via File Explorer: You can also open the %TEMP% folder with this cmd.
[PS] explorer.exe $env:TEMP

Removing the Temp Files
[PS] Remove-Item -Path "$env:TEMP\*" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Additional info Command (More Formatted)
[PS] Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending -Property WorkingSet | Select-Object -First 50 Name, Id, @{Name="Memory_MB";Expression={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet/1MB,2)}}

View Startup Items
[PS] Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_StartupCommand | Select-Object Name, Command, Location

Review Running Services (optional)
[PS] Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | Sort-Object DisplayName | Format-Table DisplayName, Status

If you find any unnecessary heavy processes, close them manually or consider using this.
[PS] Stop-Process -Id <ProcessID> -Force

|---Disk Space and Cleanup Utilities---|

Launching Disk Cleanup
[CMD-P] cleanmgr
...or...
[PS] Start-Process cleanmgr.exe
...or...
You can also automate it
[CMD-P] cleanmgr /sageset:1 & cleanmgr /sagerun:1

Repair System Files and the Windows Image
[CMD-P] sfc /scannow

DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management).
This repairs the Windows image if needed.
[CMD-P] DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

|---Security-Scans---|

Malware and Security Scans
Run a Full Windows Defender Scan via PowerShell
[PS] Start-MpScan -ScanType FullScan

Schedule an Offline Scan
FYI: An offline scan requires a reboot and runs before Windows fully loads.
[PS] Start-MpWDOScan

For Mechanical Drives – Defragmentation: If you use an HDD, defragment your drive.
[CMD-P] defrag C: -w -v

For SSDs – Optimize/Trim: Windows automatically runs TRIM on SSDs, but you can invoke optimization manually.
[CMD-P] defrag C: -o -v
(Do not defragment SSDs in the traditional sense, as TRIM is more appropriate.)

Check for Windows Updates
[PS] UsoClient StartScan

Check and Adjust Power Settings, This lists power schemes.
[CMD-P] powercfg -L

You can then set a scheme, for example, if “High performance” is listed with a GUID.
[CMD-P] powercfg -S <GUID>

***Side Note - you can use Win+R and a box will pop up, type in 'mrt' to scan your computer for issues, choose the type of scan (Quick, Full[recommended], or Custom) ***
Reboot your system.
